# Keys Theme

#### **About**

The keys theme is a CSS library inspired by the aesthetic of modern gaming equipment, such as mechanical keyboards and RGB components. The initial vision of the library featured HTML buttons styled to look like keycaps. This idea then soon evolved to adapt an electronic device theme with matte finishes and metallic sliders, both currently in-lined with modern graphic design trends.
